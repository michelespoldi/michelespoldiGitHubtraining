## Overview

This lab will give you practice writing functions that incorporate math, booleans, conditional, and swift statements. 

##Instructions
In this final lab within this section, you'll be creating three functions. All of your functions should be written in the `ViewController.swift` file located in the `AllTheBasics.xcodeproj` file.

**1** - Create a function `averageIsAbove75(a:b:c:)` which takes in three arguments labeled as `a`, `b` and `c` all of type `Double`. This function should return back a `Bool` value. In your implementation of this function you should calculate the average of the three arguments passed into this function. If the average is greater than 75.0, then return `true`, else return `false`.

For example, if we were to call on this function we would get the following results:

````Swift
averageIsAbove75(a: 55, b: 25, c: 24)
// false

averageIsAbove75(a: 100, b: 85, c: 90)
// true
````



**2** - Create a function `passwordCombo(username:password:)` which takes in two arguments. The first argument labeled `username` should be of type `String`. The second argument labeled `password` should be of type `Int`. This function should return back a `String` value. The `String` value you should return depends on whether or not the username/password combination is correct.

What makes it correct? `username` must be either 'Jerry', 'Elaine', or 'Michael'. The password must be divisible by 3. If both conditions are true, then return back the `String` "Welcome!". If either fail, then the `String` value to be returned should be "Access Denied"

Calling this function should yield the following results.
````Swift
passwordCombo(username: "Bran", password: 22)
// "Access Denied

passwordCombo(username: "Elaine", password: 20)
// "Access Denied"

passwordCombo(username: "Elaine", password: 33)
// "Welcome!"
````






**3** - Create the function `describe(emoji:)`. It should take in one argument of type `String` and return back a `String`.

You should switch on the `emoji` argument in your implementation and return back a `String` value describing the emoji that is passed in as an argument. The emoji's and their descriptions you should include in your switch statement are the following:

üíã - "Kiss"  
üêà - "Cat"  
üê¢ - "Turtle"  
üçï - "Pizza"  
üëª - "Ghost"  

For the default case, we should return back the `String` "Unknown".
